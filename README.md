# 👋 Hi, I'm Pixelklicker!

I'm a **hobby developer** passionate about building **web applications** — especially with **PHP** and **Laravel**.  
I enjoy turning ideas into functional, elegant, and well-structured code – from small tools to complete web projects.



## 💻 About Me

- 🧠 Mainly coding with **PHP**, **Laravel**, and **Blade**  
- 🌐 Passionate about **web apps**, **APIs**, and **clean code**  
- 🎨 Interested in **frontend usability** and **modern UI design**  
- 📚 Currently exploring **Laravel Livewire**, **Filament**, and **Tailwind CSS**
